# ❔What is this repo?
This is a repo full of GDI effects by me, Made for my GDI malwares or just for fun. I hope you enjoy these payloads!

# 💙 For Skidders
I know you skids will use these effects and not release open source (except NotCCR.) So for that reason I put a GPL 3.0 license. So that means if you use my effects or modify them. You have to give me credits and release the open source!
